![](https://github.com/najirh/netflix_sql_project/blob/main/logo.png)

## üìå Project Overview
- Dataset used: `netflix_titles.csv` (8,807 records, 12 columns)  
- Technology: **PostgreSQL**  
- Focus: Writing **20+ practical SQL queries** that are commonly used in real-world data analysis.  
- Concepts Covered:
  - Aggregations (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, etc.)
  - `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
  - `JOIN`s
  - `CTE` (Common Table Expressions)
  - `WINDOW functions`
  - `SUBQUERIES`
  - `CASE` statements
  - String & Date functions

## üîé Key Business Questions Answered
Some examples of insights explored:
1. How many Movies vs. TV Shows are available on Netflix?  
2. What are the most common content ratings?  
3. Which countries produce the most content?  
4. How has Netflix‚Äôs content grown year by year?  
5. What are the most popular genres?  
6. Who are the top directors and actors?  
7. What is the average duration of Movies?  
8. Which year had the highest releases?  
9. Seasonality: Which months see the most content added?  
10. Percentage of Movies vs. TV Shows.  

üëâ A total of **22 carefully designed queries** have been written to cover a wide range of analysis.

## üìä Example Queries
```sql
-- 1. Count Movies vs TV Shows
SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM netflix
GROUP BY type;

-- 2. Most common rating
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM netflix
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY total_count DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- 3. Top 10 countries with most titles
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS total_titles
FROM netflix
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_titles DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
